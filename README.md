ShareSketch is a feature-rich collaborative drawing and idea sharing platform built on the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. It enables groups of people to unleash their creativity through real-time drawing collaboration, interactive chat, and seamless sharing of ideas. The project leverages the power of **Socket.IO** to provide a dynamic and engaging environment for users to connect, communicate, and create together.
